    This document is a manual on advanced emoticon usage
  for emailing, instant-messaging, forum posting and any
  other form of text-based communication on the net.
  
    An emoticon -- short for "emotion icon" -- is a small
  string of text that can be used to represent a human 
  facial expression, emotion, or action.
  
    This manual came about after I was having some trouble
  communicating a sarcastic comment over instant-messaging.
  
    I tried doing an internet search for an emoticon that
  could appropiately express sarcasm, and quickly found
  that there is an incredibly vast selection of emoticons
  that can be used for a large range of different meanings.
  
    Seeing that a lot of emoticon information is mostly 
  spread out on the net over different sites, different
  pages, or just word of mouth, I set out to confine as
  much information about emoticon usage to a single 
  plaintext document.
  
    I hope that this guide will be a useful way to quick-
  ly and easily find an emoticon for whatever emotion you
  may find yourself needing to convey without using actual
  words.
